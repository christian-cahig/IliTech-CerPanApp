# IliTech-CerPanApp

`IliTech-CerPanApp` is a custom LaTeX class
for automated production of the Certificate of Panel Approval
as required of special projects, theses, and dissertations
in Mindanao State University - Iligan Institute of Technology.

For the class definition, please see [`template/cerpanapp.cls`](./template/cerpanapp.cls).
To get started, please refer to the starter file [`cert.tex`](./cert.tex).

## Notes

`IliTech-CerPanApp` is a thin extension of the `scrbook` class
from the [KOMA-Script bundle](https://ctan.org/pkg/koma-script).
It has been developed and tested on a local Windows 10 machine
with [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) version 2022.

An Overleaf project template,
entitled
[*MSU-IIT Certificate of Panel Approval*](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/msu-iit-certificate-of-panel-approval/hhwtmkbmdrnt),
is also available.
Due to Overleaf policy, it may take a day or two before the template reflects
the latest `IliTech-CerPanApp` version.

This project is inspired by a similar effort by Abdul Aziz Mabaning.
Being my first foray into creating custom LaTeX classes,
I found
[the Overleaf tutorial *Writing your own class*](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Writing_your_own_class)
and
[the MDPI LaTeX template](https://www.mdpi.com/authors/latex)
to be very helpful.
